# What is the significance of base fee

The fee youâ€™re willing to pay per operation in a transaction.
This differs from the Effective Base Fee which is the actual fee paid per operation for a transaction to make it to the ledger. When the network is in surge pricing mode, the effective base fee varies based on an auction mechanism. When it's not, the effective base fee defaults to the network minimum currently at 100 stroops per operation.
